# docopts examples

Thoses scripts are bash source code examples using docopts binary built by go in the main project folder.

## JSON API examples

Change to `cd ./examples/` and try any code localy.
Examples here uses the JSON API.

`old_docopts_api/` contains all previous example written for docopts before JSON API.

Same as for this folder, `cd ./old_docopts_api/` and execute examples relative to that folder.

## Usage

First, build `docopts` binary.

Then:

cd to the `examples/` directory and try any code localy.

Change dir to subfolder, the same way, if you want to try other examples.
